### 🚀 **Project Goal**
Free-Ai is designed to intercept and block (Sinkhole) network requests and tracking scripts. Instead of relying on unpredictable AI models, it uses deterministic **Regex patterns** and **Python logic** to ensure total privacy and performance.

### 💎 **Key Features**
* **DNS Sinkholing:** Instantly stops trackers and malicious domains before they even load. 🚫
* **No AI Dependencies:** 100% predictable results based on established logical rules. 🧠
* **Rate Limiting:** Protects your infrastructure by filtering out traffic spikes. ⏳
* **Supabase Integration:** Real-time logging of blocked requests for deep analysis. 🔄
